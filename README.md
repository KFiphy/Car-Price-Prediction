# Car-Price-Prediction


In today's automobile market, the ability to precisely estimate car pricing is extremely beneficial to both customers and industry experts. Understanding the elements that drive automobile costs can lead to more educated decision-making and better financial outcomes, whether you're buying a car or developing competitive pricing tactics. This project intends to use data-driven analysis and predictive modelling to make better purchasing and selling decisions while improving overall market efficiency and transparency. We hope to construct a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting a car's price by analysing a large dataset encompassing numerous features such as automobile specifications, market trends, and economic indicators.
